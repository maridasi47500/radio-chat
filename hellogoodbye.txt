You say yes, I say no
You say stop and I say go, go, go
Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello, hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello, hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello
I say high, you say low
You say why, and I say I don't know
Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Do you say goodbye goodbye

Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello, hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello, hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello
You say yes, I say no (I say yes but I may mean no)
You say stop and I say go, go, go (I can stay till it's time to go)
Oh, oh no
You say goodbye and I say hello, hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello, hello, hello
